* put only used variables in fn definitions
* remove public from fn (only on structure, see *.cmap)
* refactor tree, set, pool (maybe, double chained list of free, ...)
* prototype creation KO (map not initialized)
* cmap-tuning.h: memory, chunk size; pool, size; slist, chunk size; ...
* map: (key, val) in pool
* map: rm new(), add prototype in init
* NULL test before fn call (tree, nested, ...)
